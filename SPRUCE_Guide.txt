SPRUCE Pipeline Guide

Before beginning, here are a few questions for your consideration:
1) What environmental and other spatial variables are likely to affect population structure, and are these available to download?
2) What is the geographic range you are interested in? Do you have reasonable coverage (of genetic samples) over this range?
3) What time frame are you interested in? This will affect how you filter the IBD segments.

Note that Parts 1 and 2 can be done in any order or in parallel.

Part 1: Generate migration surfaces using MAPS (See also https://github.com/halasadi/MAPS)

1.A: Prepare genomic data ("1A_Merge_Filter.sh" provided as an example)
Identify the genomic data you would like to include. Merge and filter, and split by chromosome. Data should be in plink format (bed/fam/bim).

1.B Perform haplotype phasing, exclude close relatives, and call identical by descent tracts ("1B_Phase_and_CallIBD.sh")
Alternative option: https://github.com/halasadi/ibd_data_pipeline

1.C. Convert start and end from genomic positions to centimorgans ("1C_Interpolate_Position_to_cM.R", adapted from https://github.com/halasadi/ibd_data_pipeline/blob/master/interpolate.R))

1.D Concatanate the ibd segments from each chromosom into one file (below)

cat $IBD_OUT/Pagani_Scheinfeldt_ibd_chr*_merged_cM.ibd > $IBD_OUT/Pagani_Scheinfeldt_ibd_chr_all_merged_cM.ibd

1.E Convert .ibd file to .sims format for MAPS ("1E_IBDfile_to_sims.sh", adapted from https://github.com/halasadi/MAPS/tree/master/convert_beagle)
You will need to edit script according to your selected IBD tract sizes and run once for each time interval

1.F Create and accessory files (.outer, params-test-lower_upper.ini) to your MAPS folder, and then run the MAPS software
You will need to run the software separately for each time period

1.G Run plotmaps (See "https://github.com/halasadi/plotmaps")
You may find a conda environment helpful to install plotmaps

R
library(plotmaps)
plot_maps(add.pts = TRUE, add.graph = TRUE, add.countries = FALSE,
	  longlat = FALSE, mcmcpath = "/Pagani_Scheinfeldt/2_6/2_6-MAPS-test-sim",
	  outpath = "/Pagani_Scheinfeldt/2_6/plotmaps", width = 10, height = 6)

plot_maps(add.pts = TRUE, add.graph = TRUE, add.countries = FALSE,
	  longlat = FALSE, mcmcpath = "/Pagani_Scheinfeldt/6_Inf/6_Inf-MAPS-test-sim",
	  outpath = "/Pagani_Scheinfeldt/6_Inf/plotmaps", width = 10, height = 6)


1.E Extract migration rate values from the MAPS output files 

Part 2: 

2.A Prepare spatial variables ("GenerateSpatialVariables")
See also: https://github.com/evlynpless/MOSQLAND
In general: download spatial variables, crop to region of interest, and set the no data value to something sensible

2.B Extract environmental values from the coordinates corresponding to the demes in Step 1.E

Part 3: Random forest regression ("3_SPRUCE_RandomForest.R")
Find associations between the environmental/spatial variables and the migration rates over space. Use cross-validation to validate.
User will need to run the script separately for each time period and may also need to perform some tuning of the model.
